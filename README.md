# Spotify-Music-Streaming-Analysis
This project performs an end-to-end analysis of the Spotify dataset to explore streaming patterns, trends, and predictive insights.
Introduction

This project analyzes Spotify streaming data from Kaggle using data exploration, cleaning, and predictive modeling to identify hit songs.

Objective

To classify songs as "hit" or "not hit" based on their number of streams using machine learning techniques.

Methodology
Data Exploration – examined dataset structure, summary stats, and distributions.
Data Cleaning – handled missing/invalid values and standardized data.
Forecasting – created a target column (1 = hit, 0 = not hit) by comparing streams against the average; applied Random Forest Classifier to predict outcomes.
Visualization – used a heatmap for correlations and a confusion matrix to evaluate model accuracy.

Conclusion

The analysis shows that streaming data can effectively predict song performance, with the Random Forest model providing reliable classification of hit vs. non-hit songs.
